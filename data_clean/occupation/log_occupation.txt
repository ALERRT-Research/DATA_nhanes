Added employment indicator. I also added a variable for why someone was not
employed (including retirement). Finally, I added a variable for number of
hours worked (past week) and dropped categories/values for DK/refused.

Fixed coding of occupational code descriptions. Now dataset contains an
indicator for which census codes (1990 or 2000) it uses. I also added three
indictors for first responders (current, longest, ever). I found ~550 in the
dataset.

Set up initial codes but found major differences in occupational codes across
years (1999-2004 vs 2005 onward). Need to resolve before moving forward.
