Fixed coding of occupational code descriptions. Now dataset contains an
indicator for which census codes (1990 or 2000) it uses. I also added three
indictors for first responders (current, longest, ever). I found ~550 in the
dataset.

Set up initial codes but found major differences in occupational codes across
years (1999-2004 vs 2005 onward). Need to resolve before moving forward.
